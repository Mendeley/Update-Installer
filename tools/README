This directory contains a set of tools for preparing auto-updates.

 * create-packages.rb

	Given a directory containing the set of files that make up a release,
	laid out as they are when installed and a JSON package config file,
	this tool generates a set of packages for the release
	and a file_list.xml listing all the files that make up the release.

 * config-template.json

    This is a template for the config file that specifies:

	- How to partition the files that make up an installed application
	  into packages.
	- The path of the main binary to run after the update completes
	- The name of the updater binary to download as part of the update

    This is the simplest possible package configuration, where all files for
	a release are placed in a single package.  This means that the whole
	package will need to be downloaded to install the update.

 * auto-create-packages.rb
	
	<input old version dir> <input new version dir> <output dir> -v <version> [-o <old version>]
	
	This tool generates a zip file from difference of old version and new version of an application files.
	The zip file name contains versions like this:  OldVersion_NewVersion.zip
	The zip file contains generated package (out.zip) an file_list.xml and  updater.exe and libbz2.dll 
	this file needed in user system for update.
	Note: updater.exe is build in Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2015
